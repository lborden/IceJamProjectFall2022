# This repository contains information regarding the Mohawk River Ice Jam Project for CEE/EAR600M002: Environmental Data Science.

# Introduction
Upstate New York is known for its fierce winters, leading to large build ups of snow and ice deposits, especially in rivers. The Mohawk River is a 149-mile-long water way acting as the largest tributary of the Hudson River. There has been a history of ice jam formation on the Mohawk, so stream gauges and arial radar data is used to analyze the likelihood of future ice jams occurring.
